## Todos for Wednesday, Feb 7, 2018:
* How to think through problems step-by-step when prorgamming? What's an algorithm?

* *Review: what are APIs?*
* Browser APIs (requests, events API)
* RESTful API actions (i.e., 'GET' requests)

## *Collaborative Project*

### What you'll do:
#### Design & create a interactive client-side app that:
* Allows users to search for all the GitHub repositories that belong to a particular organization or company
> Github API documentation: https://developer.github.com/v3/orgs/
* Visually segment different repositories based on the main programming language used in that repository 

### What you'll learn:
* How to make RESTful requests using AJAX on the client-side and understand the client-side/browser APIs
* How to read and interpret the response (JSON) 
* How to turn that JSON into something you can use with your code. (JSON API) 
* Learn about the native events APIs (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) 
https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_addeventlistener.asp
* Learn how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript (for example, add more DOM elements to the DOM representation of your HTML without changing your html document. 
* Learn about using a third-party library for certain functions instead of the native functions in your browser (e.g., jQuery)


### Things to consider when working on this collaborative project: 
* What will you try to accomplish first? 
* Add new features step by step. As you add more features that require new skills, adding the next feature will be easier. 
* Think about how to delegate so you avoid having more than one or two people working on the same part of a file. 

### Scheduling: 
* Week 1 (Feb 12-14)- 
> * Create a static design or wireframe for the different states your app will have (e.g., what does the user see when they first land on your app?), consider the number of different states your app will have. 
> * Turn the static wireframe into html and css
* Week 2 (Feb 21) 
* Week 3 (Feb 26-28)
